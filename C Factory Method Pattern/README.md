This program is an example of implementation of Factory Method Design Pattern

Factory Method defines a method for producing objects in a base class, but allows subclasses to change the type of object that will be created.

This program creates three test messages and displays it in the entry box. Three notification types (SMS, Email and Push) are made by subclasses of Notification Factory class.
